abstract: >-
  IceNet is a python library that provides the ability to
  download, process, train and predict from end to end.
  Users can interact with IceNet either via the python
  interface or via a set of command-line interfaces (CLI)
  which provide a high-level interface that covers the above
  abilities.


  This project demonstrates the use of the python library
  API for forecasting sea ice for a reduced dataset to
  demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of IceNet, from
  source data download to forecast generation.
